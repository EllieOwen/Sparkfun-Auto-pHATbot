The Bangood self-balancing robot I will use for a chassis is this one https://www.banggood.com/DIY-Smart-RC-Robot-Car-Self-balancing-Car-APP-Control-Compatible-With-Arduino-p-1427016.html?akmClientCountry=America&utm_design=41&utm_source=emarsys&utm_medium=Shipoutinform171129&utm_campaign=trigger-emarsys&utm_content=Winna&sc_src=email_2671705&sc_eh=baaf08149f00f9ea1&sc_llid=12393951&sc_lid=104858042&sc_uid=ALdPQMSVJ1&cur_warehouse=CN
The chassis has two gearmotors with encoders.  It came with an Arduino Clone and did balance.  I was not able to find any instructions in English to really use it.  I will initially put a caster on this chassis.  Later I may impliment self-balancing.
